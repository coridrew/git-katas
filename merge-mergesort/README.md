# Git Kata: Merge Mergesort
In this kata you will be facing your first merge conflict!
There will be two different branches:

* Mergesort-Impl
* master

The task is to look at the merge conflict, and solve it by editing the file accordingly.

## Setup:

1. Run `. setup.sh` (or `.\setup.ps1` in PowerShell)

## The task

1. Run `git branch` to see the two branches present
2. Merge from `Mergesort-Impl`
3. Solve the merge conflict and finish the merge (`git status` will tell you what to do)

## Relevant commands
- `git branch`
- `git merge`
- `git status`
- `git mergetool`
- `git add`
- `git commit`
- `gitk --all`
